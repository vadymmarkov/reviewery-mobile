GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback
in **Reviewery**. Be sure to check our [FAQ](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/reviewery-mobile/wiki/FAQ)
and [past issues](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/reviewery-mobile/issues?state=closed)
before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful,
but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to
be of any use.
